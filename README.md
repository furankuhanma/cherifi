I will make this app vibe-coded but i will document every step of the way.

This app is like spotify but for my personal use only. I will try to add features from spotify premium and put on this app for free
and also i will get rid of ads so i can enjoy music continously.

Im also planning to put ai or maybe advance so i can get the best recommendations according to my current feeling and music taste.


Front-end looks good made by google gemini so i will proceed to make the back-end.

The first feature i'm going to add is the youtube api, i need to fetch data from youtube and it must play as mp3. and when it comes to searching youtube there's alot of video so this app will automatically filter out those and more focus on music searching. and i will get rid of the mock up data


Now that it's working, it can fetch music, the ai is working i will start to add the download feature like sqlite  so i can use it offline.

the offline feature is now available so there are more things to add like 


the shuffle, repeat, next, etc. feature on the player component. I need to make it functional.(smart recommending algorithm)
